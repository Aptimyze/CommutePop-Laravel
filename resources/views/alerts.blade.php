    <p>If you commute to school or work on TriMet, you've probably experienced a nagging feeling towards the end of your work day. Am I going to miss my ride home? If I do, will it be 10 minutes until the next one? Thirty?</p>
    <p>CommutePop is here to help. Tell us when you normally leave, and toward the end of your day, we'll send you an email with a list of upcoming departures using live data from TriMet, and when you need to leave your desk to catch them. No more guessing. No more worrying.</p>
