    <h3>Live transit times. Right to your inbox. Right when you need them.</h3>
    <p>If you commute to school or work on TriMet, you've probably experienced a nagging feeling towards the end of your work day. Am I going to miss my ride home? If I stay at my desk for another 5 minutes, will it cost me 30 minutes waiting for the next one?</p>
    <p>CommuteAlert is here to help. Tell us when you normally leave, and toward the end of your day, we'll send you an email with a list of upcoming departures using live data from TriMet, and when you need to leave your desk to catch them. No more guessing. No more worrying.</p>
